Input Format:
You will be given an integer array of size N.

Constraints
1 < N < 10^5
0< = A[i]< = 1

Output Format
You need to print the count of 1's.

### Presents to Masha

*(PresentMasha.java)*

```
Little Artem got n stones on his birthday and now wants to give some of them to Masha. He knows that Masha cares more about the fact of receiving the present, rather than the value of that present, so he wants to give her stones as many times as possible. However, Masha remembers the last present she received, so Artem can't give her the same number of stones twice in a row. For example, he can give her 3 stones, then 1 stone, then again 3 stones, but he can't give her 3 stones and then again 3 stones right after that.
How many times can Artem give presents to Masha?

Input Format
You will be given a function which contains a single integer n, number of stones Artem received on his birthday.

Constraints
1 <= n <=10^9

Output Format
Return the maximum possible number of times Artem can give presents to Masha.

### First repeating element

*(FirstRepeatingElem.java)*

```
Given an array of integers, find the first repeating element in it. We need to find the element that occurs more than once and whose index of first occurrence is smallest.

Input Format
You will be given a function with an integer array as arguments.

Constraints
1 < N < 10^5
1 < a[i] < 10^5

Output Format
You need to return the first repeating element from the function.

### Count Bigger

*(CountBigger.java)*

```
You will be given an array and a number and you need to count how many numbers are bigger than this number and print this count to the stdout.

Input Format
You will be taking a number as an input using stdin which tells about the length of the array. On another line, array elements should be there with single space between them. Another line will have the number for which you have to do the comparison.

Constraints
1 <= L <= 1000
1 <= Ai <= 1000

Output Format
Print the count to the stdout.

Sample TestCase 1
Input:
5
10 11 12 44 66
22
Output:
2
Explanation:
There are only two numbers which are greater than 22 that are 44 and 66.
```

### Linear Search

*(LinearSearch.java)*

```
Given an array of numbers of size n and integer x. Search whether x is present in array or not. If yes, return true else return false. You need to perform linear search on the given array. 

Input Format
You will be given an array of integers of size N and integer X.

Constraints
1 < N < 10^5
1 < A[i] <10^5
1 < X < 10^5

Output Format
You need to return boolean value from the given function.

*(BinarySearchRecursive.java)*

```
Given an array of numbers of size n and integer x. Search whether x is present in array or not. If yes, return true else return false. You need to perform binary search on the given array. 

Input Format
You will be given an array of Integers and An Integer X.

Constraints
1 < N < 10^5
1 < A[i] < 10^5
1 < X < 10^5

Output Format
You need to Print 'Yes' if the X is present in the array and 'No' otherwise.

### Occurrence of M

*(OccuranceSearch.java)*

```
Rohan is given an array of N integers and an integer M. Rohan has to tell the number of times M is present in array. Rohan has to go to play an important match. Can you complete the task for him.

Input Format
The first line of input consist of number of test case, T
The first line of each test case consists of two space separated integers, N and M.
The second line of each test case consists of N space separated integers.

Constraints
1<= T <=10
1<= N <=100
1<= M <=1000

Output Format
For each test case, Print the number of times M is present in array
